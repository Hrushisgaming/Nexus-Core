## 🌌 Overview

**Nexus Core** is a next-generation desktop intelligence built to function like an authentic JARVIS workstation. Combining real-time bi-directional native voice audio, multimodal computer vision, autonomous code self-evolution, and local system orchestrations, Nexus Core transforms your Windows PC or Mac into a self-evolving command center.

## ⚡ What's New in Nexus Core Evo

### 1. 🔌 Holographic Hardware Assembler & Circuit HUD
- **Screen & Voice Part Recognition**: Nexus scans your screen via computer vision or parses voice commands (`"Nexus, how to connect DHT11 to Arduino Pro Mini"`) to recognize microcontrollers (Arduino Uno, Pro Mini, ESP32), sensors (DHT11, HC-SR04 ultrasonic, servos), and passive components.
- **In-App Interactive Pop-up**: Opens a compact, dark glassmorphic popup overlay directly inside Nexus showing:
  - Component cards with pinout labels (`VCC`, `DATA`, `GND`, `2`, `p8`, `p9`).
  - **Animated glowing neon SVG wires** with real-time flowing white electron pulse dots.
  - Numbered pin bubbles (`①`, `②`, `③`, `④`, `⑤`).
  - Operating voltage safety callouts and ready-to-flash Arduino C++ firmware.

### 2. 🧬 Project Ultron — Self-Evolving Autonomous Skill Crucible
- **On-the-Fly Code Synthesis**: When asked to execute a task outside its built-in toolkit, Nexus identifies the capability gap, writes a brand-new Python tool into the writable per-user skills vault, tests it inside an isolated sandbox ("The Crucible"), and auto-registers it dynamically without restarting the application.
- **Persistent Vault**: All forged skills are saved in the writable per-user Nexus Core skills vault (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/NexusCore/skills` on Windows or `~/Library/Application Support/NexusCore/skills` on macOS) and hot-reloaded automatically.

### 3. 🛡️ Proactive Auto-Heal Engine
- **Self-Repairing Codebase**: Background sentry catches runtime exceptions, analyzes tracebacks using LLM root-cause reasoning, applies dynamic patches to the faulty code, and presents an interactive HUD repair telemetry card without crashing the assistant.

### 4. 🌊 Real-Time FFT Audio Waveform & Dynamic Glow Core
- **Live Physical Frequency Spectrum**: 9-bar reactive audio visualizer embedded directly into the Command Bar.
- **Dynamic State Glow States**:
  - 🟡 **Gold**: Standby / Listening
  - 🔵 **Cyan / Blue**: Capturing Voice (Live Energy Wave)
  - 🟣 **Purple**: Nexus Reasoning / Thinking
  - 🟢 **Green**: Executing Tool / System Action
  - 🔴 **Red**: Muted

### 5. 🧩 Visual Chain-of-Thought Execution Tracker
- **Agentic Step-by-Step HUD Cards**: Collapsible execution traces embedded directly into chat bubbles.
- Features sub-second execution latency chips (`[180ms]`, `[120ms]`), status badges (`COMPLETED`), and expandable `[Inspect]` drawers for parameters and raw JSON payloads.

### 6. 🌐 Interactive 3D HoloGlobe & Geospatial Radar
- **3D Earth & 2D Street Mapping**: WebGL spherical Earth globe with live great-circle flight routes, real-time aircraft radar tracking, turn-by-turn highway driving routes, and nearby POI scans (hospitals, fuel, ATMs).

### 7. 🎵 Official Spotify MCP Server Integration
- Built on the open **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for robust, reliable music playback, album/artist searches, queue control, volume adjustment, and active device handover between PC and mobile.

### 8. ⚙️ Centralized API Setup Hub
- Complete Settings UI featuring dedicated cards for every connected service:
  - Google Gemini API (Live Voice & Vision)
  - Spotify MCP (Client ID & Client Secret)
  - OpenRouter / Anthropic
  - Weather & Radar APIs
  - Instagram & Smart Home
  - Instant live test-connection buttons.
